Hello, my friends! Welcome to my world!
----


I am a first-year Phd student of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, under the joint supervision of Prof. [Ying Fu](https://ying-fu.github.io/) and Prof. [Junliang Xing](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1116/5088.htm) at Qiyuan Laboratory. 

I obtained my M.S. in School of Big Data & Software Engineering at Chongqing University in 2025, supervised by Prof. [Chunlei Fu](https://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/7374.htm) and B.Eng in School of Electronic and Information Engineering at Dalian University of Technology in 2022. And I worked as a research assistant at the NLPR, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences from 2023 to 2024, supervised by Prof. [Zhenan Sun](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/znsun/).

My research interests lie in the intersection of `Computer Vision` and `Machine Learning`. In the past, I was focused on `video generation`, and now I have started exploring the delights of `multimodal generation`.
